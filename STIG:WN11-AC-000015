.SYNOPSIS
    This PowerShell script ensures a secure account lockout duration before the bad logon counter is reset to prevent successful brute-force password attacks. 
    The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system.

    PS C:\> .\STIG-WN11-AC-000015.ps1 
#>

# Sets the Account Lockout Reset counter Duration to 15 minutes.
